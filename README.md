# nonlinear-optimization

Coursework in Nonlinear optimization, written in matlab. 

Includes implementation of nonlinear optimization algorithms such as 
- Nelder-Mead (derivative free) 
- two different Quasi-Newton methods (BFGS and DFP)Co
- conjugate gradient and Polak-Ribiere for quadratic programming problems 
- Gauss-Newton for nonlinear least squares 
- Armijo-Goldstein linesearch
- Sequential Quadratic programming for nonlinear constrained problem.
Implementations are written for model problems such as the Rosenbrock function, or a real life problem an oil-refinery had in the case of SQP.
